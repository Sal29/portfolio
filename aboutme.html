    <h2>About me</h2>
   <p>I'm a rising junior at Centreville High Schools. I joined Girls Who Code because I want to explore different careers I can pursue in the future. Girls Who Code will help me determine if coding is something i'm intereseted in therefore it can help me decided if computer science is a field I would like to pursue in. Even if I decided not to purse a career in computer science I believe coding is an important skill to have.</p>
